# Aurora

## UNSTABLE WORK IN PROGRESS
<ul>
<li>Dependency/System requirements are subject to change at any time.
<li>This is a personal project with entirely inadequate planning and no deadline. This is not enterprise code. However, I will never push a non-compiling commit or a commit that throws warning when compiled, any errors with the compilation process likely have to do with dependencies or system differences.
</ul>

## STATUS
<TEMPORARILY ON HOLD>
Pre-Alpha: No major gamebreaking bugs, not feature-complete, no end objectives (yet), little testing cross platform.

## Description
Survive the wilderness, battle a wide variety of creatures, and save the world from an icy fate with only the lights to guide you in Aurora, a survival RPG with simple graphics reminiscent of Rogue [1980] and an expansive world with deep mechanics.

## Supported Operating Systems:
<ul>
<li> Linux (Some Distributions) </li>
<li> MAC OS X </li>
</ul>

## Requirements:
<ul>
<li> C++14
<li> Boost Library (Makefile assumes symbolic link)
<li> NCURSES
</ul>

## Statement
Aurora is a passion project that is worked on in my free time, with the goal being at least one commit a day that indicates forwards progress for the game as well as progress towards mastery of C++. Because the vision of the game is constantly shifting, the code base is bound to be slightly messy until a final product is reached and the end goal becomes consolidated. At that point, the code will be carefully refactored, but until then the priority is a working game over a polished codebase. There is, and will be, no deadline for finishing, just consistent updates pushed every day. Have fun!
